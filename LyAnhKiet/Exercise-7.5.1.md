Exercise 7.5.1

**Use the class BoundedQueue2 for questions aâ€“f below. A compilable version is available on the book website in the file BoundedQueue2.java. The queue is managed in the usual circular fashion.**<br>
Suppose we build an FSM where states are defined by the representation variables of BoundedQueue2. That is, a state is a 4- tuple defined by the values for [elements, size, front, back]. For example, the initial state has the value [[null, null], 0, 0, 0], and the state that results from pushing an object obj onto the queue in its initial state is [[obj, null], 1, 0, 1].**<br>

**(a) We do not care which specific objects are in the queue. Consequently, there are really just four useful values for the variable elements. What are they?**<br>

**(b) How many states are there?**<br>

**(c) How many of these states are reachable ?**<br>

**(d) Show the reachable states in a drawing.**<br>

**(e) Add edges for the enQueue() and deQueue() methods. (For this assignment, ignore the exceptional returns, although you should observe that when exceptional returns are taken, none ofthe instance variables are modified.)**<br>

**(f) Define a small test set that achieves Edge Coverage. Implement and execute this test set. You might find it helps to write a method that shows the internal variables at each call.**<br>

### a)

The four values for elements are [ null, null ], [ obj, null ], [ null, obj ] and [ obj, obj ]
[ obj, null ] and [ null, obj ] are different at the representation level

### b) 

The number of states = Element * size * front * back = 4 * 3 * 2 * 2 = 48 total states.

### c)

Of the 48 states, only 6 are reachable.

### d)

The exceptions (enqueue() on full queues and dequeue() on empty queues) as well as observer method. Result in "loop transitions from a state back to itself.
These are not shown on the diagram for clarity and from a grading perspective, aren't relevant. Labels on nodes show the values of the representation state variables : Elements, size, front and back.

### f)

We have small test :
```java
@test
{
Queue q = new Queue();
Object obj = new Object();
q.enqueue(obj);
q.enqueue(obj);
q.dequeue();
q.enqueue(obj);
q.dequeue();
q.dequeue();
q.enqueue(obj);
q.dequeue();
