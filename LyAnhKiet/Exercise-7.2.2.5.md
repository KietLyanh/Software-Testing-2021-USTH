Exercise 7.2.2.5

**Answer questions aâ€“g for the graph defined by the following sets:**<br>

**N = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}**<br>

**N0 = {1}**<br>

**Nf = {7}**<br>

**E = {(1, 2), (1, 7), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 1)}**<br>

**Also consider the following (candidate) test paths:**<br>

**p1 = [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 1, 7]**<br>

**p2 = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 6, 1, 7]**<br>

**p3 = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6, 1, 7]**<br>

**(a) Draw the graph.**<br>

**(b) List the test requirements for Edge-Pair Coverage. (Hint: You should get 12 requirements of length 2.)**<br>

**(c) Does the given set of test paths satisfy Edge-Pair Coverage? If not, state what is missing.**<br>

**(d) Consider the simple path [3, 2, 4, 5, 6] and test path [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 6, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 1, 7]. Does the test path tour the simple path directly? With a sidetrip? If so, write down the sidetrip.**<br>

**(e) List the test requirements for Node Coverage, Edge Coverage, and Prime Path Coverage on the graph.**<br>

**(f) List test paths from the given set that achieve Node Coverage but not Edge Coverage on the graph.**<br>

**(g) List test paths from the given set that achieve Edge Coverage but not Prime Path Coverage on the graph**<br>


### a)

[The link of the graph](https://cs.gmu.edu:8443/offutt/coverage/GraphCoverage?edges=1+2%0D%0A1+7%0D%0A2+3%0D%0A2+4%0D%0A3+2%0D%0A4+5%0D%0A4+6%0D%0A5+6%0D%0A6+1%0D%0A&initialNode=1&endNode=7&action=Nodes)

### b)

|Test Paths|	Test Requirements that are toured by test paths directly|
|---|---|
|[1,2,4,6,1,7]|	[1,2,4], [1,7], [2,4,6], [4,6,1], [6,1,7]|
|[1,2,4,5,6,1,7]|	[1,2,4], [1,7], [2,4,5], [4,5,6], [5,6,1], [6,1,7]|
|[1,2,3,2,3,2,4,6,1,7]|	[1,2,3], [1,7], [2,3,2], [2,4,6], [3,2,3], [3,2,4], [4,6,1], [6,1,7]|
|[1,2,4,6,1,2,4,6,1,7]|	[1,2,4], [1,7], [2,4,6], [4,6,1], [6,1,2], [6,1,7]|

### c)

From the b), p3 does NOT satisfy Edge-Pair Coverage.

### d)

No

With a sidetrip: [6, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6]

### e)

TR node coverage: [1] [2] [7] [3] [4] [5] [6]

TR edge coverage: [1,2] [1,7] [2,3] [2,4] [3,2] [4,5] [4,6] [5,6] [6,1]

TR prime paths: [3,2,4,5,6,1,7] [2,4,5,6,1,2] [1,2,4,5,6,1] [3,2,4,6,1,7] [5,6,1,2,4,5] [6,1,2,4,5,6] [4,5,6,1,2,4] [4,5,6,1,2,3] [2,4,6,1,2] [1,2,4,6,1] [6,1,2,4,6] [4,6,1,2,3] [4,6,1,2,4] [3,2,3] [2,3,2]

### f)

Not possible

[1,2,3,2,4,6,1,7]
[1,2,4,5,6,1,7]

### g)

Not possible

[1,2,3,2,4,6,1,7]
[1,2,4,5,6,1,7]
