Exercise 9.1.2.4

**Consider the following BNF:**

```
A ::= 0 B | 0 M | 0 B M
0 ::= "w" | "x" | "s" | "m"
B ::= "i" | "f" | "c" | "r"
M ::= "o" | "t" | "p" | "a" | "h"
```
**(a) How many nonterminal symbols are in the grammar?**<br>

**(b) How many terminal symbols are in the grammar?**<br>

**(c) Write two strings that are valid according to the BNF.**<br>

**(d) For each of your two strings, give two valid mutants of the string.**<br>

**(e) For each of your two strings, give two invalid mutants of the string.**<br>

## a)

There are 4: A, 0, B, M

## b)

There are 13: *the letters in ""*

## c)

String 1: wio

String 2: xft

## d)

Mutant valid string 1: wft

Mutant valid string 2: xio

## e)

Mutant invalid string 1: wfi

Mutant invalid string 2: xfi
