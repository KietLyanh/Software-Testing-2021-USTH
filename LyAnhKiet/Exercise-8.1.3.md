Exercise 8.1.3

**Write the predicate (only the predicate) to represent the requirement:“List all the wireless mice that either retail for more than $100 or for which the store has more than 20 items. Also list non-wireless mice that retail for more than $50.”**

Def
  - number of wireless mice = nwm
  - price of wireless mice = pwm
  - number of non-wireless mice = nnwm

(nwm > 20) ^ (pwm > 100) ^ (nnwm > 50)
