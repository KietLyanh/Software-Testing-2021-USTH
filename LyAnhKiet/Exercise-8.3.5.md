Exercise 8.3.5

**Answer the following questions for the method checkIt() below:**

```java
   public static void checkIt (boolean a, boolean b, boolean c)
   {  
      if (a && (b || c))
      {
         System.out.println ("P is true");
      }
      else
      {
         System.out.println ("P isn't true");
      }
   }
```
**(a) Transform checkIt() to checkItExpand(), a method where each if statement tests exactly one boolean variable. Instrument checkItExpand() to record which edges are traversed. (“print” statements are fine for this.)**<br>

**(b) Derive a GACC test set T1 for checkIt(). Derive an EdgeCoverage test set T2 for checkItExpand(). Build T2 so that it does not satisfy GACC on the predicate in checkIt().**<br>

**(c) Run both T1 and T2 on both checkIt() and checkItExpand().**<br>

## a.  The code to transform checkIt() to checkItExpand() :

public static void checkItExpand (boolean a, boolean b, boolean c)
{
  if (a)
        {
          if (b)
          {
            System.out.println ("1: P is true");
          }
          else if (c)
          { // !b
             System.out.println ("2: P is true");
          }
          else
          { // !b and !c
             System.out.println ("3: P isn't true");
          }
         }
         else
         { // !a
            System.out.println ("4: P isn't true");
         }
}

b.  If we number the truth table in the usual way, we have : 
GACC pairs for clause a are {1,2,3} x {5,6,7}
GACC pair for clause b is (2, 4).
GACC pair for clause c is (3,4)
So, a GACC test set T1 for checkIt() needs to have test {2,3,4} and one of {5,6,7}
For edge coverage for checkItExpand(), we need Txx and Fxx for clause a, TFx and TTx for clause b, and TFT and TFF for clause c
=> We could pick test set T2 = {1,3,4,8}, which have Edge Coverage on checkItExpand()

c, Code Run both T1 and T2 on both checkIt() and checkItExpand()
